career-profile:
    title: Introduction
    summary: |
      Hello and welcome to my curriculum vitae.

      I am Bart, a data architect with many years of programming experience, and it is my passion to create a Linked Data world where data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Let me help you create, maintain and make use of ontologies to formally describe your data in a machine-readable way; to make the right architectural choices to prevent bottlenecks and rigid top-down management and empower data engineers to autonomously produce their data; to seamlessly exchange and integrate data even outside of the company; to enhance collaboration between domain experts and data engineers; to build knowledge graphs so data scientists can get the most out of their LLMs.

      I am particularly familiar with the Semantic Web technology stack (RDF(S), OWL, SHACL, SPARQL, etc.) and LinkML for data and information modeling, and with Data Mesh for a bottom-up, decentralized architecture, but since I have a firm grasp of the underlying principles I can easily adapt to different technologies and paradigms. I also have experience writing software which transforms data models from one metamodel to another, e.g. transform a SHACL shapes graph to an Avro schema.
      
      As a colleague I really like helping others. I’m patient and a careful listener. I’m not very fond of chit-chat, but if we share an interest or have a similar sense of humor you’ll probably find me a lot more talkative.
      
      I love discussing deeper philosophical and scientific topics. Other (perhaps obvious) interests are computer science and mathematics. I’m crazy about music and film, and I also like to read. If you’re curious about my taste, please click the *Music*, *Films* and *Books* links in the *Interests* section. And to prove to you I’m not a snob: I also like cartoons (but only the good ones).
      
      If you think there's a nice opportunity to work together, or even if you share some of my interests and would like to chat, please feel free to drop me an e-mail. I would love to get to know you better.

education:
    title: Education
    info:
        - degree: Mathematics
          university: Radboud Universeit Nijmegen
          time: 2006 - 2011
          details: |
            - Academic math problems can be very challenging, and because of their abstract nature they train your mind in a general sense in terms of problem modelling and solving ability.
            - It is here that I first got in touch with programming, through a course covering programming fundamentals in C++. Thanks to learning programming fundamentals and the low-level language C++, I’ve come to appreciate and better understand some higher level concepts used today.
  
  
        - degree: Teacher of Mathematics (2nd degree) 
          university: Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen (HAN)
          time: 2005 - 2006
          details: |
            - I intentionally finished only the first year to obtain my “propedeuse” certificate, which allowed me to enroll at the university where I wished to study Mathematics.
            - People chose me to do my presentation at the annual symposium, because they thought my practice lesson in class was the best. They particularly agreed that my explaining was clear and structured.

experiences:
    title: Experiences
    info:
        - role: Data Architect / Software Developer
          time: 2022 - now
          company: Alliander
          details: |
            - I've collaborated with other architects and teams to implement a Data Mesh architecture in the organization. Thanks to my technical background, I can speak the language of both business and IT, which really helps to bridge the gap.
           - I am one of the few experts in using the Semantic Web technology stack for our data and information modeling to facilitate strong and formal semantics, flexible decoupling of conceptual from logical data models and to enable code generation, etc.
           - I've developed the Metamorph project (written in Clojure), which generates technical schemas from a logical data model in SHACL.

        - role: Software Engineer (Backend)
          time: 2019 - 2022
          company: Alliander
          details: |
            In this team I helped realizing image recognition solutions. We trained object detection models to recognize gas and electricity meters, their readings and other related componenets. What I did mostly was:
            - Building and maintaining RESTful APIs, and reusable utility packages.
            - Improving our software and development quality, i.e. CI/CD, package management and tools such as code autoformatters.
            - Write scripts to transform data or that make part of a machine learning pipeline.

        - role: Test Automation Developer / Software Engineer
          time: 2017 - 2019
          company: Alliander
          details: |
            I was part of the team responsible for managing the IT process of contractors and mechanics that had to maintain or install customer gas and electricity installations. I was responsible for taking care of automating the testing process:
            - I wrote business-friendly test suites, generic resuable test code for use in test suites (also outside the team) and libraries to extend Robot Framework’s capabilities.
            - I created a set of programs, including a Windows GUI, to allow manual testing flexibly. I automated fetching data from SAP and writing it to Excel sheets. Users could adjust and complete the data there, and generate or send a SOAP message with the push of a button. I was the sole maintainer of these programs, including releasing and guiding users.

        - role: Web Developer
          time: 2016 - 2016
          company: Ensie
          details: |
            Using the Symfony framework, I developed new features for the website (on a freelance basis).

        - role: XSL Developer
          time: 2015 - 2016
          company: Clipit News
          details: |
            - Writing and maintaining XSL templates that crawled the web for news content.
            - To improve our workflow, I turned a simple sheet into a more practical collaborative ‘todo-list-like’ system (called [The Maintenance Sheet](https://github.com/bartkl/cv/tree/master/_portfolio/the-maintenance-sheet)) for our developers, including the automatic import of log entries from our backend software. 

        - role: Web Developer (intern)
          time: 2013 - 2014
          company: HostingXS / Emixion
          details: |
            - These companies provided internships, which I applied for since I was in need for a job. I did not hang around for long at these places.

        - role: Backend/Web Developer and Lead Service Desk
          time: 2011 - 2013
          company: e*cube
          details: |
            - I wrote small BI applications using the rapid development tool Kettle.
            - Specializing in webshops, e*cube had an impressive database setup with associated APIs. Here I learned SQL and got my first taste of programming from the MVC philosophy.
            - I’ve become fluent on the Linux command-line and also wrote some shell scripts for system administation purposes.
            - As the tidy perfectionist of the team, I maintained the company wiki and much of the project documentation.
            - I took upon me most of the service desk tasks, supporting customers and keeping our backlog of reported issues orderly.

        - role: Mailman
          time: 2007 - 2011
          company: TNT Post
          details: |
            - Every Saturday I sorted and delivered mail.
