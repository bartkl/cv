career-profile:
    title: Introduction
    summary: |
      Hello and welcome to my curriculum vitae.

      I’m a software developer with a background in mathematics. A bit more about me personally though.

      Music, film and literature provide my life with color. Furthermore I love discussing and learning about ethics, politics and philosophy.

      In recent years I’ve become increasingly motivated to align my behavior with my ethical beliefs. To this end I’ve become vegan and have started donating to charity, inspired by the Effective Altruism philosophy.

        - Academic math problems can be very challenging, and because of their abstract nature they train your mind in a general sense in terms of problem modelling and solving ability.
        - It is here that I first got in touch with programming, through a course covering programming fundamentals in C++. Thanks to learning programming fundamentals and the low-level language C++, I’ve come to appreciate and better understand some higher level concepts used today.

        - People chose me to do my presentation at the annual symposium, because they thought my practice lesson in class was the best. They particularly agreed that my explaining was clear and structured.
