    title: Introduction
    summary: |
      Hello and welcome to my curriculum vitae.

      I’m Bart, and I'm a computer programmer. I like to solve complex abstract problems, and do so elegantly. I'm a perfectionist with a strong opinion, and love writing beautiful code and documentation.

      As a colleague I view myself as someone who really likes to help others out. I'm patient, and a careful listener. I'm not very fond of chit-chat, but if we share an interest or humor you'll probably find me a lot more talkative. I love discussing and learning about ethics, politics and philosophy. Other (perhaps obvious) interests are computer science and mathematics.

      I'm crazy about music and films, and I also like to read. If you're curious about my taste, please click the *Music*, *Films* and *Books* links in the *Interests* section 😊. To prove to you I'm not a snob: I also love cartoons, like *South Park*, *Rick & Morty* and *Ren & Stimpy*. Also, I love specialty coffee (also known as [Third Wave Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee)). Hmm, that probably made me a snob again.

      If you like to contact me, please feel free to e-mail me :).

education:
    - degree: Mathematics
      university: Radboud Universeit Nijmegen
      time: 2006 - 2011
      details: |
        - Academic math problems can be very challenging, and because of their abstract nature they train your mind in a general sense in terms of problem modelling and solving ability.
        - It is here that I first got in touch with programming, through a course covering programming fundamentals in C++. Thanks to learning programming fundamentals and the low-level language C++, I’ve come to appreciate and better understand some higher level concepts used today.


    - degree: Teacher of Mathematics (2nd degree) 
      university: Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen (HAN)
      time: 2005 - 2006
      details: |
        - I intentionally finished only the first year to obtain my “propedeuse” certificate, which allowed me to enroll at the university where I wished to study Mathematics.
        - People chose me to do my presentation at the annual symposium, because they thought my practice lesson in class was the best. They particularly agreed that my explaining was clear and structured.

experiences:
    - role: Backend Developer
      time: 2019 - 2021
      company: Alliander
      details: |
        In team FAAM I helped realizing image recognition solutions. We trained object detection models to recognize gas and electricity meters, their readings and other related componenets. What I did mostly was:
        - Building and maintaining RESTful APIs, and reusable utility packages.
        - Improving our software and development quality, i.e. CI/CD, package management and tools such as code autoformatters.
        - Write scripts to transform data or that make part of a machine learning pipeline.

    - role: Test Automation Developer
      time: 2017 - 2019
      company: Alliander
      details: |
        I was part of the team responsible for managing the IT process of contractors and mechanics that had to maintain or install customer gas and electricity installations. I was responsible for taking care of automating the testing process:
        - I wrote business-friendly test suites, generic resuable test code for use in test suites (also outside the team) and libraries to extend Robot Framework’s capabilities.
        - I created a set of programs, including a Windows GUI, to allow manual testing flexibly. I automated fetching data from SAP and writing it to Excel sheets. Users could adjust and complete the data there, and generate or send a SOAP message with the push of a button. I was the sole maintainer of these programs, including releasing and guiding users.

    - role: Web Developer
      time: 2016 - 2016
      company: Ensie
      details: |
        Using the Symfony framework, I developed new features for the website (on a freelance basis).

    - role: XSL Developer
      time: 2015 - 2016
      company: Clipit News
      details: |
        - Writing and maintaining XSL templates that crawled the web for news content.
        - To improve our workflow, I turned a simple sheet into a more practical collaborative ‘todo-list-like’ system (called [The Maintenance Sheet](https://github.com/bartkl/cv/tree/master/_portfolio/the-maintenance-sheet)) for our developers, including the automatic import of log entries from our backend software. 

    - role: Web Developer (intern)
      time: 2013 - 2014
      company: HostingXS / Emixion
      details: |
        - These companies provided internships, which I applied for since I was in need for a job. I did not hang around for long at these places.

    - role: Backend/web developer and lead service desk
      time: 2011 - 2013
      company: e*cube
      details: |
        - I wrote small BI applications using the rapid development tool Kettle.
        - Specializing in webshops, e*cube had an impressive database setup with associated APIs. Here I learned SQL and got my first taste of programming from the MVC philosophy.
        - I’ve become fluent on the Linux command-line and also wrote some shell scripts for system administation purposes.
        - As the tidy perfectionist of the team, I maintained the company wiki and much of the project documentation.
        - I took upon me most of the service desk tasks, supporting customers and keeping our backlog of reported issues orderly.

    - role: Saturday's mailman
      time: 2007 - 2011
      company: TNT Post
      details: |
        - Every Saturday I sorted and delivered mail.
